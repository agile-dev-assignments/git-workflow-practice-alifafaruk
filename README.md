### Article [A software engineer has made a bot that tweets whenever new COVID-19 vaccine appointments are available in New York City](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-turbovax-twitter-covid-19-vaccine-appointment-bot-2021-2)

### Summary 
This article is about a Twitter bot and website that tweets and updates whenever appointment slots open in New York for the COViD-19 vaccine. The website shows all vaccination sites in New York, the number of appointment slots available, and when the last availability was for a vaccine. 

This bot and web-app were created by a software developer Huge Ma, who works for Airbnb. What is interesting about this website, is that Ma is deciding whether to make his code open source for developers across the country to create similar websites for vaccinations. 

### What I found interesting about the article
It is interesting to see how software development can be used for social good. Creating a bot that tracks vaccine availability will end up helping a lot of New York State residents. It made me think of other ways tech can be used for social good initiatives, like creating activist toolkit websites.

It is also interesting to see the lack of technological advancements on the part of the government. Technology is needed in today's society to transfer information to the public. Government websites do not provide adequate information regarding vaccine availability and are ineffective.

### Forked comment: Kaylee
I also find this article interesting to see how the Twitter bot can be used to find updates on the COVID vaccine appointments. And quite frankly, as of now, it seems like the bot is accurate enough that there have been a lot of compliments from the followers. However, as mentioned from the above comment, it is indeed surprising to see how the government did not initiate this technology but a software engineer. Also, the article mentions that by mid-January, a quarter of the people who got a shot in NYC weren't residents, and I also think that if the government put more effort in checking on the eligibility and bypassing through technology, this problem can be eliminated immediately. 

### Adam Ethan's Comment
I agree with how difficult it is to find information on government websites. I am surprised that the NYC government hasn't created an easily accessible scheduling website yet. The importance of software development and open-source projects has surged throughout the pandemic.
